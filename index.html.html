    <h1>RAMONES</h1>
    <h2>1-2-3-4</h2>
    <p>Ramones. The surprise saviors of rock and roll. From just the name Ramones, you can hear 
     Dee Dee's brash scream in your head, "1-2-3-4!" then a tidal wave of electric guitars 
     like chainsaws roaring in the hands of a masked man running towards you from the dark of 
     the night, the famed wall-of-sound of Tommy's drums so fast the crowd felt like they had to
     sprint to keep up, and Joey's faux-British, precise, dynamic voice tearing through 
     the jet engine roar like lightning, white hot, the sound of a band on fire. Forest Hills, 
     Queens, New York: ground-zero of the powder keg explosion culminated from the combined pressure 
     of disco on the radio and self-indulgent arena rock taking the music away from its rebellious, 
     underdog, anti-hero roots to elite, extravagant virtuosos forgetting their audience four 
     minutes into the drum solo. The Ramones were amateurish musicians, but genius in their 
     songwriting, schtick, and most importantly delivery of their brand of naked, screaming, campy, 
     and dangerous rock.</p>

    <h2>Members</h2>
    <p>Taking their name from an anecdote they heard about Paul McCartney using the pseudoname 
     Paul Ramon in hotels, the Ramones found their name.  Early on they wanted the world to
     think they were brothers, so they each took on a charactature of themselves using Ramone 
     as the common surname.  Originally, Dee Dee was going to sing and Joey was going to drum, 
     but Dee Dee's throat got sore after a couple of songs.  Tommy was going to be their manager, 
     but Joey had the voice and he couldn't drum and sing at the same time and none of the 
     drummers the auditioned couldn't keep up with the 1/8 notes on the high-hat like Tommy would
     demonstrate.  Johnny was always going to be Johnny. After getting a couple cheap Mosrite 
     guitars at a pawn shop, giving Dee Dee the bass, and Tommy on drums until they found their 
     permanent drummer, their friend Marc Bell in Richard Hell's band the Voidoids, the lineup of 
     the band the would set rock on fire was set.</p>

    <p>Not listed is Elvis Ramone. Clem Burke of Blondie sat in with the Ramones after Marky got 
     kicked out.  He came up with the iconic name, but in my book, he didn't make the cut. Richie 
     ended up replacing Marky, then he was shown the door when the band wanted Marky back. C.J. 
     replaced Dee Dee in 1989, if memory serves, after Dee Dee suddenly announced he was quitting 
     Ramones to pursue a career as a rapper, rebranding himself Dee Dee King. Fortunately, that was 
     short lived. Even more fortunate was that although he never rejoined the Ramones as a member, 
     he never quit writing songs for them.</p>
