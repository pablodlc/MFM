# My Favorite Musician: RAMONES

## Intro

This is a second chance. I started this course in a full-time program and got a medical note to transfer to this part-time program.  I'm grateful and excited to have this opportunity, so I'm going to come out swinging to learn everything I can. The toughest part of this assignment is picking a favorite. I'm not really sure who my favorite band is, but most of my favorite music would not exist if it hadn't been for the Ramones' groundwork. So I've chosen the Ramones for my fanpage assignment because aside from being the groundbreakers they were, the are also one of my favorites. Since I have some knowledge of HTML, this wasn't a particularly hard assigment, but I spent a lot more time writing the bio than I had expected.  I'm looking forward to styling this as the bonus to the next exercise.


## Instructions

Here are the instructions copy/pasta'ed 
1. Open VS Code, create a new file, and save it as fanpage.html. It's important to include the .html extension so that VS Code knows what type of file it is and how to read it.

2. Create the structure for your page. Reference the panda website you just created. Be sure to include the !DOCTYPE declaration and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags where appropriate.

3. Add content to your page. Your page can be about whatever musician or band you want, but it must include the following:

*    Proper page structure:

        a. `#!DOCTYPE` declaration

        b. `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags

        c. A `<title>` for the page

*    At least one image (with an alt attribute)

*    A link to another website

*    An ordered or an unordered list (favorite songs, albums, band members, etc.)

*    A bio section with `<p>` tags for formatting

*    Use of `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags for headings

*    A video of the musician or band singing or playing a song

*    Proper indentation

Your finished page should look something like one of the following examples:  

*in trying to manage the length of the UNGRADED, PRE-WORK assignment's README, I exluded the example images of HTML pages from the module*

4. Upload your `fanpage.html` file.

*also excluded in the interest of brevity is the Helpful Hints section from the module*  

**BONUS**  
* Make your link(s) open in a new tab.

* Add a favicon to your site (the little icon that appears on the browser tab).

* Make a table.

## Conclusion

I had fun making this page. Nothing too special about it, but is was fun to wax poetic about the Ramones.  Here's a GIF of the finished page:
